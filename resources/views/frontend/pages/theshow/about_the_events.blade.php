                        <h2>Nepal: A Premier Healthcare Destination</h2>
                        <p>
                            The medical value travel industry has emerged as one of the fastest growing segment of tourism industry despite the global economic downturn. According to the FICCI – IMS Report, India is one of the key MVT destinations in Asia with over 500,000 foreign patients seeking treatment. MVT can be a 9 billion USD opportunity by 2020 through adequate focus and effective execution.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            India need to focus on dual objectives of “tourism friendliness” and “patient centricity”. However, achieving the stated vision of being “The Provider to the World” would necessitate coordinated efforts by all key stakeholders.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            India is emerging as a preferred healthcare destination for patients across the globe. Growing at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27%, the inflow of medical tourists in India is likely to cross 3.2 million in 2016. World class treatment and state of the art hospitals in India have created a very favorable atmosphere for patients with varying degrees of illness to avail the best facilities for their treatment.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Our endeavour, through the “Advantage Health Care – India 2017” is to showcase India and its immense pool of medical capabilities as well as create opportunities for healthcare collaborations between the participating countries.

                        <h5><u style="color: #0a0a0a">MVT can be a 9 billion USD opportunity by 2020 through adequate focus and effective execution</u></h5>
                        <p>
                            As outlined above, India needs to diversify its sources of medical tourism and offerings to create a strong value proposition which would help India in becoming leader in medical tourism.
